To execute the application run "SmileFEC.exe" under Distribution.

The database file is "FEC_DATABASE.db" which is created by the application
if it does not exist. If you have encrypted a database, then the file is "FEC_DATABASE.db.enc"


Note: The Samples folder contains a sample database filled with randomly generated info, which can be used to test the application.
